The CDK folder defines the infrastructure that supports all runtime components of the Inventory Management System. It contains stack definitions, shared configuration, and cross-stack wiring logic.

Current components
These are the currently implemented stacks in the CDK folder.
- App (bin/app.ts): Entry point that initializes all stacks, resolves stage configuration, and links stack outputs.
- AuthStack: Creates the authentication layer using Cognito resources and exposes identifiers for use by the API.
- DynamoStack: Creates the primary DynamoDB table and all related indexes used across routers.
- ApiStack: Creates the Lambda-based backend API and associated gateway. Injects environment variables and required permissions.
- WebStack: Creates the CloudFront distribution and the S3 bucket that serves the frontend build artifacts. Configures proxy routes to the API.
- S3UploadsStack: Provides the S3 bucket used exclusively for file uploads (images, documents). Exports bucket identifiers and grants write/read permissions to the API.
- SesStack: Defines the SES identity and configuration set used for system emails such as invitations and onboarding.
- Stage configuration (stage.ts): Central configuration resolver that sets per-environment values used across all stacks.

Usage of components
Below are the current CDK components and what they provide to the system. These values are consumed by the API, frontend, Lambda handlers, and automated systems through environment variables, stack outputs, and IAM role grants.

AuthStack
- Provides Cognito resources: user pool, app client, domain, issuer URLs.
- Supports mandatory email verification and MFA.
- Sets OAuth redirect URLs using stage configuration.
- Makes user pool information available to ApiStack for authentication.

DynamoStack
- Creates the main DynamoDB table (${service}-${stage}-data).
- Defines primary keys (PK, SK).
- Enables KMS encryption, PITR, TTL, Contributor Insights, and stage-dependent deletion rules.
- Supplies all GSIs used by the API, including:
  GSI_WorkspaceByName
  GSI_UsersByUid
  GSI_UsersByUsername
  GSI_RolesByName
  GSI_UserRoleLookup
  GSI_ItemsByTeam
  GSI_ItemsByAsset
  GSI_FormsByAsset
  Additional GSIs required for item profiles, form records, and workspace lookups (full list provided in dynamo-stack.ts).

ApiStack
- Contains the Lambda that executes all API routing logic.
- Wraps the Lambda with API Gateway HTTP API.
- Configures CORS using stage-derived allowed origins.
- Receives and injects:
  Cognito pool identifiers
  AllowedOrigins
  SES configuration
  Dynamo table details and index names
  S3 upload bucket name and encryption key
  Web distribution URL
- Grants the API Lambda:
  DynamoDB read/write access
  S3 object read/write/delete access
  SES send permissions
  Cognito admin abilities used by the Auth router.

WebStack
- Creates the S3 bucket hosting the built frontend.
- Creates the CloudFront distribution that serves the frontend.
- Proxies requests such as /trpc/*, /health, and /hello to the API.
- Makes the API URL available to the frontend at deploy time.

S3UploadsStack
- Provides the uploads bucket for all file-based storage.
- Enables server-side encryption using a managed KMS key.
- Exposes the bucket and key identifiers for API use.
- Grants the API write, delete, and head-object access.

SesStack
- Creates the system email identity used for onboarding and notifications.
- Optionally attaches SNS topics if a stage supports feedback logging.
- Exports sender addresses and configuration set names.

Stage configuration
- Computes the active stage (dev, prod, optional beta).
- Defines removalPolicy, autoDeleteObjects, tags, Lambda sizing, and CORS policies per environment.
- Provides stage outputs used by all stacks to ensure resources are named and configured consistently.

Example usage
The CDK system exports values that are consumed by the rest of the application. Examples include:
- ApiStack uses AuthStack.userPoolId for authentication.
- WebStack uses ApiStack.apiEndpoint to proxy requests.
- ApiStack injects DynamoStack.tableName into the Lambda.
- S3UploadsStack grants ApiStack the ability to upload images for the S3 router.

Example integration
When the API executes an image upload, the uploadImage method uses:
- S3UploadsStack bucket (via environment variable)
- DynamoStack indexes to determine team or item context
- ApiStack IAM permissions to write the uploaded file
- WebStack distribution URL for later display

Todo
The following details require additional information to complete this file:
<> Missing GSI list beyond those visible in repo summary
<> Additional Lambda handlers beyond the main API and PDF stamper
<> SES domain or Route53 configuration if present
<> Beta-stage overrides if that environment is in use
